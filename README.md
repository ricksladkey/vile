## Vile Editor: Vi Like Emacs

This is my fork of vile.  The original vile was written by Paul Fox and is currently maintained by Thomas Dickey at:

* [http://invisible-island.net/vile/](http://invisible-island.net/vile/)

This version contains the following additional features:

* Build hints for various platforms
* Support for bold and italic fonts under [ConEmu](https://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/)
* Support for [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) files

The branch *upstream* contains the original files imported from Invisible Island.
