  Support</a></h1>

  <p>Vile supports the use of Perl as an extension language by
  embedding a Perl interpreter into the editor.</p>

  <p>The "--with-perl" configure option enables Perl support at
  build time on Unix hosts (for Win32 instructions see the file
  README.PC).</p>

  <p>After the executable is successfully built, up to date
  documentation for the API in various formats may be obtained from
  the following make targets (not built by default):</p>
  <pre>
    vile-perl-api.doc   (unix and win32)
    vile-perl-api.man   (unix hosts only)
    vile-perl-api.html  (unix hosts only)
</pre>

  <p>A recent version of Perl is required. The interface was
  developed and tested using 5.004_04. The most recent version of
  Perl may be retrieved from the URL:</p>
  <pre>
    <a href=
"http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz</a>
</pre>

  <p>The Perl interpreter requires subsidiary files, the location
  of which is coded into the Perl library. As such, if a
  Perl-enabled Vile binary is to be installed onto multiple
  machines, the same version of Perl must be installed on each
  target machine, in the same location.</p>

  <p>This also means that if a newer version of Perl is installed,
  Vile must either be rebuilt against the new version, or the
  version-specific directory (given by "perl -V:archlib") of the
  old version must be retained.</p>

  <p>Note also that embedding a Perl interpreter into Vile will
  increase the size of the binary. On many platforms, a shared Perl
  library may be built which, at the cost of a load-time
  performance penalty, can substantially reduce the size of the
  compiled vile, xvile, [nvi, apache, etc, ...] and of course perl
  binaries.</p>

  <p>See also the output of "perl -V:useshrplib" and the section
  "Building a shared libperl.so Perl library" in the "INSTALL" file
  from the Perl distribution.</p>

  <p>The Perl interface for vile was originally written by Kevin
  Buettner in 1997 and 1998.</p>
