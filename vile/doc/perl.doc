                                  Perl Support

   Vile supports the use of Perl as an extension language by embedding a Perl
   interpreter into the editor.

   The "--with-perl" configure option enables Perl support at build time on
   Unix hosts (for Win32 instructions see the file README.PC).

   After the executable is successfully built, up to date documentation for
   the API in various formats may be obtained from the following make targets
   (not built by default):

     vile-perl-api.doc   (unix and win32)
     vile-perl-api.man   (unix hosts only)
     vile-perl-api.html  (unix hosts only)

   A recent version of Perl is required. The interface was developed and
   tested using 5.004_04. The most recent version of Perl may be retrieved
   from the URL:

     http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz

   The Perl interpreter requires subsidiary files, the location of which is
   coded into the Perl library. As such, if a Perl-enabled Vile binary is to
   be installed onto multiple machines, the same version of Perl must be
   installed on each target machine, in the same location.

   This also means that if a newer version of Perl is installed, Vile must
   either be rebuilt against the new version, or the version-specific
   directory (given by "perl -V:archlib") of the old version must be
   retained.

   Note also that embedding a Perl interpreter into Vile will increase the
   size of the binary. On many platforms, a shared Perl library may be built
   which, at the cost of a load-time performance penalty, can substantially
   reduce the size of the compiled vile, xvile, [nvi, apache, etc, ...] and
   of course perl binaries.

   See also the output of "perl -V:useshrplib" and the section "Building a
   shared libperl.so Perl library" in the "INSTALL" file from the Perl
   distribution.
