                   Directory-Browser Perl-extension for Vile

   There is a directory browser extension for vile written with the perl
   interface.


Features
--------
   The main features of the directory browser are:
     * two panel display for separate listing of directories and files
     * configurable color hilighting based on the type of the file
     * recognizes broken symlinks
     * hypertext based directory traversal and file viewing
     * mime aware capabilities to view files using appropriate applications
     * plugins extension to the mime library to allow to view certain files
       within vile after passing through a vile based perl filter routine.


Details
-------
   The package contains the following three perl files.
     * directory.pl
     * mime.pl
     * plugins.pl

   Detailed pod documentation is contained within each file.

   The package also contains sample files for:

     * ~/.vile/mailcap
     * ~/.vile/mime.types


Getting Started
---------------
   To get started off without reading the documentation:
    1. put all the three perl files in ~/.vile/perl
    2. put the sample mailcap and mime.types files in ~/.vile
    3. put the following lines in your .vilerc

             22 store-macro
                 ~force execute-hypertext-command
                 ~if &not $status
                     ~force forward-character-to-eol
                 ~endif
             ~endm
             bind-key execute-macro-22 ^M
             perl "use directory"

    4. open up vile and type

             :directory

    5. Press <RETURN> on directory name to change to that directory and on
       the file name to view that file.
